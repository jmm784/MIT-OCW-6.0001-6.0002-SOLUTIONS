# MIT_OCW README
My solutions to the exercises issued as part of the MIT OCW courses 6.0001 and 6.0002. All pset folders contain the solution code to the problems outlined in the problem brief (also included in the pset folders). Due to the nature of the psets and presence of multiple sub-problems within each problem, the solutions will not work out of the box and some lines will need to be uncommented to output the desired sub solution. To ensure all code runs properly use python 3.5 (the courses were originally taught in 2016 and used python 3.5 at the time).
