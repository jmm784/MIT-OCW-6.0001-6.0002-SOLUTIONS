# MIT_OCW README
My solutions to the exercises issued as part of the MIT OCW courses 6.0001 and 6.0002. All pset folders contain the solution code to the problems outlined in the problem brief (also included in the pset folders). To produce the correct output for a specific sub-problem some lines may need to be uncommented.
